# JS-Calculator

Calculator created with JavaScript. 
<br>
<br>
The app permits the user to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, showing the correct result when you hit '='. It allows any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points, having several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding.
<br>
<br>
If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed will be the last operator entered. Pressing an operator immediately following '=' will start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
